# Master integration runner — executes every E2E harness in sequence
# against the staging cluster. Exits non-zero on the first failure but
# always reports a final summary so a CI run shows which suites broke.
#
# Suites:
#   1. integration-staging.sh all   — lifecycle / fm / https / reprovision
#   2. integration-pvc.sh           — PVC + tier + cascade race
#   3. integration-tier-flip-e2e.sh — full tier flip + storage placement + fsType + fsck
#   4. integration-grow-e2e.sh      — online grow (PATCH storage_limit_override)
#
# USAGE
#   ADMIN_PASSWORD=<…> ./scripts/integration-all.sh
#
# All connection settings are env-overridable. To run against a non-
# example.test cluster (e.g. testing.example.test), pass:

#   ADMIN_HOST=https://admin.<domain>       [default: phoenix staging]
#   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@<domain>              [default: admin@example.test]
#   ADMIN_PASSWORD=<…>                      [REQUIRED]
#   HTTPS_TEST_DOMAIN_BASE=<wildcard zone>  [default: staging.example.test]
#                                           Must wildcard-resolve to the cluster
#                                           ingress IPs; required by the HTTPS
#                                           tenant-provisioning scenario.
#   CATALOG_NGINX_PHP=<UUID>                [default: seeded UUID; lookup via
#                                           GET /api/v1/catalog?limit=200 if
#                                           your cluster's catalog differs]
#
# CONTROL_HOST (the SSH target for cluster-internal kubectl probes) is
# auto-derived from SSH_HOST; override only if your control plane is
# reachable on a different IP than the bastion.
