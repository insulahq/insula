# Changelog

All notable changes to Insula are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning
is **CalVer `YYYY.M.PATCH`** (no leading-zero month — valid SemVer; [ADR-045](docs/07-reference/ADR-045-versioning-release-cycle-and-upgrade.md)).
Releases are cut ad-hoc with `scripts/cut-release.sh` (see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)).

> A `### BREAKING` subsection in a release marks changes that break operators or
> APIs. Auto-update refuses to auto-apply any release whose section contains one
> until an operator acknowledges it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`platform-ops` operator CLI** ([ADR-045](docs/07-reference/ADR-045-versioning-release-cycle-and-upgrade.md)
  W17): a self-contained Node SEA binary (`scripts/build-platform-ops.sh`) that
  imports the backend TS modules directly — no logic duplication. First tranche
  of read-only subcommands: `version` (offline-first; enriches from the DB when
  reachable), `cluster status`, `cluster diagnostics`, `migrations list` (stub
  until the registry ships), and `shell`. `release.yml` builds amd64 + arm64,
  cosign-signs them (offline, key-based), and attaches them as Release assets;
  bootstrap installs + verifies them (see W8). Covered by Vitest unit tests +
  `scripts/test-build-platform-ops.sh` (real build + sign→verify→install
  roundtrip, CI job `platform-ops binary build`).
- **Bootstrap phase library + platform-ops install** ([ADR-045](docs/07-reference/ADR-045-versioning-release-cycle-and-upgrade.md)
  W8): `scripts/lib/bootstrap-phases.sh` now owns a `phase_platform_ops` step
  that bootstrap.sh runs at end-of-run on the first server — it cosign-verifies
  and atomically installs the `platform-ops` operator CLI to `/usr/local/bin`,
  persists the trust anchor to `/etc/platform/cosign.pub`, and lays down a daily
  `platform-ops-update.timer`. Best-effort + fail-closed (an unverified binary is
  never installed); a dormant no-op until the release pipeline publishes a signed
  binary. Covered by `scripts/test-platform-ops-install.sh` (CI `shell-unit-tests`).

### Changed
- `bootstrap.sh` now sources `scripts/lib/bootstrap-phases.sh`; the legacy
  single-file `curl | bash` install one-liner is no longer supported (clone the
  repo or use `--remote`, both of which already carry `scripts/lib/`).
- `platform/cosign.pub` is committed as the trust anchor for `platform-ops`
  release verification (see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) to provision the key).

### Fixed
- `phase_platform_ops` (W8) verify now passes `--insecure-ignore-tlog` so
  key-based verification works **offline** (releases are signed without a Rekor
  log entry; the pinned public key is the trust anchor) — without it the
  cluster-down install path failed "signature not found in transparency log".
- `phase_platform_ops` no longer uses a `RETURN` trap for temp cleanup (it
  leaked past the function and re-fired on the caller's return with out-of-scope
  vars under `set -u`); cleanup is now explicit at each return.

## [2026.6.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Version spine** ([ADR-045](docs/07-reference/ADR-045-versioning-release-cycle-and-upgrade.md)):
  `platform/VERSION` (CalVer) is the single source of truth, flowing through CI →
  the `platform-version` ConfigMap → backend → DB → `GET /api/v1/admin/platform/version`,
  which now returns `{ installed, running, available }`. The backend persists
  `installed_platform_version` on startup.
- **Release cycle**: `scripts/cut-release.sh` (CalVer computation, CHANGELOG
  promotion, annotated tagging), this `CHANGELOG.md`, and `RELEASING.md`.
- **OSS readiness**: AGPL-3.0 `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  issue/PR templates, a rewritten top-level `README.md`, and per-component READMEs.
- **Image-org fork-safety**: image-building workflows derive their push org from
  `${{ github.repository }}`; `scripts/preflight-image-org.sh` repoints the
  kustomize tree for fork deploys; CI guard `scripts/ci-image-org-check.sh`.

### Changed
- `build-deploy.yml` computes the development build version from `platform/VERSION`
  (was `git describe`), so the deployed version is CalVer (`2026.6.1-<sha>`).
- `release.yml` no longer opens a PR to a `stable` branch; production Flux pins a
  tag directly. Release notes now come from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section.
